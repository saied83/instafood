# InstaFood

================

## Overview

---

InstaFood is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project that allows users to order food from a menu catalog, with features such as filtering, adding to cart, checkout, and purchase options. The project also includes authentication and authorization, with login and logout pages already built, as well as an admin panel to be implemented.
